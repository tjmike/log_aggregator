# Log Forwarding Agent

The logging agent will tail a log file and deliver its contents to a server in a timely matter.

## Log File Constraints
- The log file will only be appended, never truncated
- The log file may be rotated
  - Rotation means:
    1) Writing to the log file is stopped and all writes are flushed
    2) The log file is move to a new name
    3) A new log file is created 
- Log files are on a local file system


## Logging Environment Assumption
The logging host supports the ability to uniquely identify a file via Java's BasicFileAttributeView.fileKey. 


As an example: 
Given a log file server.log.
- If we have an input stream open to the file and the file is moved to server.log.001 we can continue to read from 
that file (now named server.log.001).

- The file system supports the concept of a unique identifier (device/inode for example) and that identifier can be
utilized from Java

- If we get the attributes of our existing file (server.log.001) and a newly created (server.log) they will be
reported by Java as different.

## Basic Operation
At startup the logging agent will begin tailing the log file. It will only capture new data from the time it is started.
The agent will forward capture log data to a server. If the server is not available or notifies the agent to back off
the agent will store the data until the server is ready. 



## Some Options To Consider
- exec tail -F to stdin and read from that stream

- use Java's WatchService to monitor files and grab data when changes are detected

- Create a reader and attempt to continually read the log file while handing events like log rotations.



Design and implement a system for distributed log aggregation.
Overview

The system will consist of two components - a log forwarding agent and a log aggregation service.
The agent

The agent is responsible for tailing a given log file and delivering its contents to a remote service in a timely manner.
The service

The service is responsible for accepting chunked log contents from the client and stitching it together, creating a copy of the original log. The contents of the log reconstructed on the server should preserve the original order of entries (lines).
Task

Your task is to design a protocol that will satisfy the above requirements and implement a server and client using this protocol. You may use whatever languages, technologies, or frameworks that you feel are appropriate. We have a preference for Java, as this team will be writing in Java, but you can make a case for using other languages. Feel free to use your best judgement on assumptions and questions you have, and start a discussion with your interviewer if needed.
Important implementation considerations for the protocol

    The protocol itself could be based on HTTP or custom TCP/UDP or protocol as long as it is documented and has a working service/agent

    The server can accept log files delivered from multiple concurrent agents

    Avoid losing parts of a log due to network unreliability

    Make sure that the resulting log files on the server donâ€™t contain any duplicate lines

    Consider strategies for coping with back pressure and overflow

Additional (design documentation is enough; feel free to implement if you feel like)

    How would you change the protocol to allow each agent to aggregate multiple log files concurrently?

    How would you design the system to allow aggregation from hundreds of thousands of agents?
